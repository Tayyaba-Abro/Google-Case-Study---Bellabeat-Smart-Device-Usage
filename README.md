## Data Analysis Process
In order to adequately analyze bellabeat data and to answer the key business questions and make recommendations, key steps of data analysis process will be followed: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

### Ask Phase:
To address the business task of analyzing that how users utilize the time smart device, the following key findings will guide the analysis:

- Proportion of Calories per Distance by Day
- Average Steps per Hour
- Total Steps & Total Distance by ID
- Maximum Sleep Duration (in hours) by Day
- Correlation of Steps with Active Minutes
- Correlation of Sleep with Active Minutes by Day

### Prepare Phase:

The data for this analysis is sourced from a public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). It comprises of 18 files containing detailed information about daily activity, sleep, weight, calories, and intensities. The dataset is structured in a combination of long and wide format, with each file containing specific information related to different aspects of smart device usage. It is important to note that the data is not from Bellabeat itself, there may be potential issues with bias or credibility.  Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the dataset is not up to date, encompassing data only for the months of April and May in 2016. Therefore, the analysis may not fully reflect the most current trends in smart device usage. Additionally, it's important to acknowledge that the dataset lacks information about the Spring product and the Bellabeat app, thereby limiting the scope of the analysis to the Time smart device.
